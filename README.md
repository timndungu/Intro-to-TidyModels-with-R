# Intro-to-TidyModels-with-R
- This is my journey in learning the tidy models as detailed here: https://www.tidymodels.org/start/
- The code is lifted and condensed to a chunks that can easily be run.
- Also included is an excerpt from Rebecca Barter's "Tidymodels: tidy machine learning in R" as detailed here: http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2020-03-25_machine_learning/
- Take a step in my shoes and see if you can learn something new - like I did. :)
